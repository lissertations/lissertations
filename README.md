# VALA Tech Camp OpenRefine Workshop
Brought to you by peppermint tea and endless frustration with GitHub Pages

Welcome to the VALA Tech Camp OpenRefine workshop! Here you will learn how to use the amazing free and open-source software [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) to make messy data a thing of the past. 

Your workshop facilitator is [Alissa McCulloch](https://twitter.com/lissertations).

## Workshop Objectives ##
By the conclusion of this workshop you will hopefully be able to do the following:

* Import and export data in and out of OpenRefine
* Facet, filter, cluster and edit data
* Transform data using GREL
* Reconcile data from an external source (VIAF)

## Setup ##
Ensure you have [downloaded OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download) before Tech Camp. It will work on Windows, Mac and Linux computers.
