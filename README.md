# OpenRefine @ VALA Tech Camp 2019
Welcome to the VALA Tech Camp OpenRefine workshop! Here you will learn how to use the amazing free and open-source software [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) to make messy data a thing of the past. 

Your workshop facilitator is [Alissa McCulloch](https://twitter.com/lissertations).

## Workshop Objectives
By the conclusion of this workshop you will be able to:

* Import and export data in and out of OpenRefine
* Facet, filter, cluster and edit data
* Transform data using GREL
* Reconcile data from an external source (VIAF)

## Setup
Ensure you have [downloaded OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download) before Tech Camp. It will work on Windows, Mac and Linux computers.

## 1. What is OpenRefine and why do I want it?
How will it help me improve my metadata? Also, a brief overview of what OR is and is not good at

## 2. Getting data into OpenRefine
Including from MarcEdit https://blog.reeset.net/archives/1873

## 3. Getting to know your data
How should your data look? Familiarisation with rows and columns, moving, renaming, etc

## 4. Simple cleaning without code: facets and filters
Including how to do these things with regex, which we learned about before lunch

## 5. Clustering and editing
AKA the killer feature of OpenRefine. Let the algorithm assist you to normalise your messy data

## 6. Transformations
Common transforms (whitespace, upper/lowercase, to null, etc) and less-common transforms (using GREL, which looks scary but is quite a friendly scripting language. Include plenty of examples and some \[links to\] canned GREL scripts for common tasks)

## 7. Reconciliation
with VIAF, because this is a library workshop. Make sure to include the http://refine.codefork.com/ link + instructions

## 8. Getting data out of OpenRefine
Recap of getting it back into MarcEdit (.tsv, basically)

## 9. Project time!
TBC
